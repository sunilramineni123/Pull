The Hospital Management System is a simple console-based application designed to streamline basic patient record-keeping functions within a healthcare facility. This Python-based program allows users to add new patients, view all existing patient records, search for specific patients by their ID, and delete patient entries when necessary. All data is stored in memory during runtime, making it ideal for small-scale testing and educational purposes. The project serves as a foundational model for more complex hospital systems and can be expanded to include features like doctor management, appointment scheduling, billing, and integration with databases or web interfaces. It is also structured to support collaborative development and version control through platforms like GitHub.
